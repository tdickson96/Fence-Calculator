# Fence Calculator

## Description

This website uses HTML, CSS, and JS to determine the estimate cost of building a fence in Ontario.  


Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


## Installation

Open the HTML browser and input the length of your fence and amount of corners. These input fields will provide the user with a fence cost estimate that is up to Ontario provincial code.

## User Story

As a prior deck and fence contractor, I noticed the subpar quality of all websites providing fence estimates. I wanted to understand where the limitations lie, so that I may provide the user with an easy to use fence calculator that even has accessible UI. Specifically, certain websites did not provide multiple fencing options such as a 4x4 post or a 6x6 post. In certain areas, building code regulations are different and require specific materials. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
