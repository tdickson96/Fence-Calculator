# Fence Calculator

## Description

Repo: https://github.com/tdickson96/Fence-Calculator

Pages: https://tdickson96.github.io/Fence-Calculator 

This website uses HTML, CSS, and JS to determine the estimate cost of building a fence in North America. The fence calculator takes the fence length, post spacing, fence height, post height, railings per section, picket width, and picket spacing as parameters .  

I wanted to create a simple fence calculator that could produce a price estimate in less than a minute.

There are many fence calculators to draw inspiration from and I found it helpful to learn server-side APIs.

## Installation

Open the HTML browser and input the length of your fence. These input fields will provide the user with a fence cost estimate that is up to Ontario provincial code. Costs are based in Canadian pricing. 

## User Story

As a prior deck and fence contractor, I noticed the subpar quality of all websites providing fence estimates. I wanted to understand where the limitations lie, so that I may provide the user with an easy to use fence calculator that even has accessible UI. Specifically, certain websites did not provide multiple fencing options such as a 4x4 post or a 6x6 post. In certain areas, building code regulations are different and require specific materials. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use.
