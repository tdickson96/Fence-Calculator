# Fence Calculator

## Description

This website uses HTML, CSS, and JS to determine the estimate cost of building a fence in North America. The fence calculator takes the fence length, post spacing, fence height, post height, railings per section, picket width, and picket spacing as parameters   


Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


## Installation

Open the HTML browser and input the length of your fence and amount of corners. These input fields will provide the user with a fence cost estimate that is up to Ontario provincial code.

## User Story

As a prior deck and fence contractor, I noticed the subpar quality of all websites providing fence estimates. I wanted to understand where the limitations lie, so that I may provide the user with an easy to use fence calculator that even has accessible UI. Specifically, certain websites did not provide multiple fencing options such as a 4x4 post or a 6x6 post. In certain areas, building code regulations are different and require specific materials. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use.
